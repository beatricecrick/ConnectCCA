## User Journey

(Created by AI)

* **Awareness** (How does the user find out about the app?)  
  * The users find out about this app because they are looking for ways to get in contact with students and don't have access to any of their information, or they feel awkward trying to message them on social media. They can get to the app through a link on the school homepage.  
* **Access & Onboarding** (How do they sign up and log in?)  
  * They can log into the system using their school emails, so the system can verify that they are from CCA.  
* **Core Action** (What is the main thing the user will do in the app?)  
  * Contact their peers for various school-related activities, by making their own chats or collaborating with other students that contacted them.  
* **Task Completion** (What confirms theyâ€™ve achieved their goal?)  
  * They have achieved their goal when the user successfully is able to contact a peer to collaborate with them.  
* **Return & Engagement** (What brings them back to the app?)  
  * Students constantly need support from each with most school assignments, so they will keep coming back to the app whenever they need to contact fellow students for a new assignment.
